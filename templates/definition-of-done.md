<!--
Each item below MUST be individually verified by running the declared
verifier. Do not bulk-check. Do not preemptively check. The visible checkbox
is the sign-off; the hidden `aitm-dod-evidence:<key>` marker is the evidence
trail. `/task check` refuses to tick a stampable Functional DoD item without
its marker; run `/task dod-stamp <key>` to produce one. The two derived keys
(`acs`, `checkboxes`) are auto-stamped by `/task close` from the body itself.
See `skill/shared/rules/functional-dod.md` for the full contract.

Kind-aware items (#681): append a `dod:kinds` HTML-comment annotation to scope
an item to a set of issue kinds. `exclude="spike,research"` renders the item for
every kind EXCEPT those listed; `include="code"` renders it only for the listed
kinds; an item with no annotation applies to every kind (the default). The
`tests` item is excluded for the no-code kinds `spike` and `research`, which ship
findings rather than code and would otherwise carry a test-suite DoD item and a
`npm run test:all` verification command they can never satisfy. Filtering happens
at render time in `preflight-issue.mjs`; a filtered-out item is simply absent, so
no phantom evidence marker is ever required for it.
