## User Story

As an agent starting or advancing work,
I want to inspect session and early-transition readiness without rebinding or moving an issue,
So that navigation predicts the same checks that execution enforces.

## Scope

Create `action-decision/session.mjs`, `promote.mjs`, and `navigation.mjs`. Modify `scripts/task-tracker/task-tracker.mjs`, `verbs/resume.mjs`, `verbs/promote.mjs`, `lib/verb-preflight.mjs`, and relevant guard producers found in Task 1. The dispatcher/resume path currently owns numeric issue binding; do not invent a nonexistent `verbs/bind.mjs`. Create `scripts/tests/integration/task-tracker/lib/action-session-promote.test.mjs`.

## Pickup Directive — MANDATORY, DO NOT SKIP

> Follow: `.ai-task-manager/templates/pickup-directive.md`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Bind/resume and early forward edges expose all required session, verb, and mutator checks with stable dispositions. <!-- aitm-verified vc-list="vc:1" -->
- [ ] Shared navigation preserves lifecycle policy, terminal Done, and indeterminate unknown state without a second state walk. <!-- aitm-verified vc-list="vc:1" -->
- [ ] Changed authority after explanation is refused by fresh execution checks. <!-- aitm-verified vc-list="vc:1" -->

## Verification Commands

- [ ] `node --test scripts/tests/integration/task-tracker/lib/action-session-promote.test.mjs scripts/tests/unit/task-tracker/lib/lifecycle-policy.test.mjs scripts/tests/unit/task-tracker/lib/guard-parity-early-stages.test.mjs scripts/tests/unit/task-tracker/lib/guard-parity-plan-develop.test.mjs` <!-- id=1 -->
- [ ] `npm test` <!-- id=2 -->
- [ ] `npm run test:slow` <!-- id=3 -->
- [ ] `npm run lint` <!-- id=4 -->
- [ ] `npm run format:check` <!-- id=5 -->
- [ ] `git log --oneline -1` <!-- id=6 -->

## Definition of Done
<!--
Each item below MUST be individually verified by running the declared
verifier. Do not bulk-check. Do not preemptively check. The visible checkbox
is the sign-off; the hidden `aitm-dod-evidence:<key>` marker is the evidence
trail. `/task check` refuses to tick a stampable Functional DoD item without
its marker; run `/task dod-stamp <key>` to produce one. The two derived keys
(`acs`, `checkboxes`) are auto-stamped by `/task close` from the body itself.
See `skill/shared/rules/functional-dod.md` for the full contract.

Lifecycle items are verified during Review. Housekeeping items are finalized
during Close; their separate headings make the owning workflow phase explicit.

Kind-aware items (#681): append a `dod:kinds` HTML-comment annotation to scope
an item to a set of issue kinds. `exclude="spike,research"` renders the item for
every kind EXCEPT those listed; `include="code"` renders it only for the listed
kinds; an item with no annotation applies to every kind (the default). The
`tests` item is excluded for the no-code kinds `spike` and `research`, which ship
findings rather than code and would otherwise carry a test-suite DoD item and a
`npm run test:all` verification command they can never satisfy. Filtering happens
at render time in `preflight-issue.mjs`; a filtered-out item is simply absent, so
no phantom evidence marker is ever required for it.

Diff-decides for `docs-only` (#865): the `tests` item deliberately does NOT
static-exclude `docs-only`. A `docs-only` issue can quietly touch code, so the
kind alone must not launder it out of the suite. Instead the `tests` item is
dropped only when the render is `--kind docs-only` AND a supplied
`--changed-paths-file` proves the `trunk...HEAD` diff is documentation-only
(default-deny: any unclassified/empty/mixed diff keeps the item). "The kind
declares, the diff decides."
